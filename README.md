## What is denki?
This project was initially created for a school module, though goes beyond the scope of what's needed. The idea however is interesting enough, so I'll be using it as a ground to test some new stuff. 

### The idea 
denki integrates a 'Smart Plug' to read the energy usage of appliances large and small. The data out of those Smart Plugs is then sent to a web app, where users are able to see their energy usage at a granular level.

## TODO 
- Probably make a Rust backend w/ SQLx + PostgreSQL
- Mess around with Arduino to refamiliarize myself with ESP8266.
